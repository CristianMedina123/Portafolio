Hello, I'm a FreeLancer dedicated to web and software development, who is passionate about providing solutions through emerging technology, I have had the opportunity to participate in some projects that have increased my knowledge as a programmer and database administrator.

I am constantly learning to learn new technologies to implement a more optimized and better defined system.

In the same way, I have been in charge of the development of some projects from scratch until the completion of the project.

Below are my skills and projects.
